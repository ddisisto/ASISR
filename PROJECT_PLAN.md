# ASISR Research Plan

**Research Authority**: This document defines the scientific goals, research strategy, and validation framework for the Adaptive Scale-Invariant Spectral Regularization project.

## Research Context & Motivation

### **Core Synthesis**
This project bridges three fundamental insights about neural network learning:

1. **ASISR Hypothesis**: Neural networks perform optimally when operating at the "edge of chaos" with spectral radius σ ≈ 1.0, balancing order and complexity
2. **Complexity-Intelligence Connection**: Models trained on complex data develop superior representations and transfer better to downstream tasks (Zhang et al., 2024 - Intelligence at Edge of Chaos)
3. **Geometric Foundations**: Deep networks create exponentially complex decision boundaries through recursive folding operations, enabling efficient learning of intricate patterns (Welch Labs geometric analysis)

### **Central Research Question**
*"Can spectral regularization targeting the edge of chaos (σ ≈ 1.0) enable neural networks to learn complex decision boundaries more efficiently than conventional training?"*

### **Scientific Significance**
- **Theoretical**: Connects dynamical systems theory (criticality) with practical deep learning optimization
- **Practical**: Could improve training efficiency for complex classification tasks
- **Methodological**: Provides framework for understanding optimal network dynamics during learning
