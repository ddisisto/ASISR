# ASISR Project Plan: Adaptive Scale-Invariant Spectral Regularization

## Current Status
- **Repository**: Initialized with git, 2 commits completed
- **Foundation**: Theoretical framework established, sample code reviewed, key research papers integrated
- **Focus Question**: *"Can spectral regularization at the edge of chaos (σ ≈ 1.0) enable networks to learn complex decision boundaries more efficiently than conventional training?"*

## Core Synthesis
This project bridges three key insights:
1. **Your ASISR Framework**: Spectral regularization targeting σ ≈ 1.0 for optimal criticality
2. **ECA Intelligence Paper**: Models trained on complex data develop superior representations  
3. **Welch Labs Geometry**: Deep networks create exponentially complex decision boundaries through recursive folding

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Environment Setup (Prerequisites)
**Dependencies**: Separate context recommended for parallel work
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Install core dependencies (torch, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, cairosvg/pillow)
- Research and implement Claude Code best practices (hooks, sub-agents, persistent tools)
- Create CLAUDE.md with project context and optimal usage patterns

### Phase 1: Boundary Mapping Proof-of-Concept (Immediate Focus)
**Goal**: Recreate Welch Labs visualization with spectral regularization
**Key Components**:
- SVG map loader component (`map_loader.py`) - *Ready for implementation*
- Baseline neural network boundary learning (extend existing `SAMPLE-CODE-v1.md`)
- Spectral regularized version with adaptive σ targeting
- Visual comparison: training efficiency, boundary accuracy, fractal dimensions

**Success Criteria**:
- Networks learn Belgium-Netherlands border classification
- Clear visual demonstration of spectral regularization benefits
- Quantitative metrics: epochs to convergence, boundary accuracy, fractal dimension

### Phase 2: Adaptive Spectral Regularization (Core ASISR)
**Goal**: Implement full adaptive system with criticality monitoring
**Key Components**:
- `AdaptiveSpectralRegularizer` class with real-time criticality scoring
- Multi-metric criticality assessment (dead neurons, perturbation sensitivity, fractal dimension)
- Dynamic σ target adjustment based on training dynamics
- Scale-invariant learning rate scheduling

**Success Criteria**:
- Adaptive system outperforms fixed σ = 1.0
- Real-time criticality monitoring guides optimization
- Robust performance across different boundary complexities

### Phase 3: Multi-Scale Architecture (Advanced ASISR)
**Goal**: Hierarchical spectral control across network layers
**Key Components**:
- Layer-specific σ targets (RG-inspired scaling)
- Multi-scale fractal analysis across network layers
- Temporal fractal dynamics during training
- Connection to transformer attention mechanisms (future work)

**Success Criteria**:
- Superior performance on complex multi-region boundaries
- Clear scaling relationships between network depth and boundary complexity
- Theoretical framework validated across different architectures

### Phase 4: Validation & Extension (Broader Impact)
**Goal**: Validate framework beyond boundary learning
**Key Components**:
- Test on standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, etc.)
- Transformer attention matrix spectral regularization
- Comparison with established regularization methods
- Publication-ready documentation and reproducibility

## Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Primary Hypothesis
Networks with spectral regularization at σ ≈ 1.0 will learn complex decision boundaries more efficiently than conventional training.

### Secondary Questions
1. **Architecture**: What's the optimal relationship between network depth and boundary complexity?
2. **Dynamics**: How do spectral properties evolve during training of complex boundaries?
3. **Fractal Connections**: Can fractal dimension predict optimal network architecture?
4. **Scale Invariance**: Do scale-invariant learning rates emerge naturally at criticality?
5. **Transfer**: Do representations learned on complex boundaries transfer better to other tasks?

## Key Metrics & Evaluation

### Efficiency Metrics
- Epochs to reach target boundary accuracy
- Training loss convergence rate
- Parameter utilization (dead neuron avoidance)

### Quality Metrics  
- Decision boundary fractal dimension
- Boundary classification accuracy
- Robustness to perturbations
- Visual similarity to ground truth

### Criticality Indicators
- Average spectral radius across layers
- Dead neuron rate evolution
- Perturbation sensitivity dynamics
- Multi-scale fractal complexity

## Implementation Strategy Notes

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Environment/Tools Setup**: Can be done in separate context
- **Claude Code Optimization**: Research best practices for this project
- **Theoretical Refinement**: Deepen understanding of scale-invariant optimization
- **Visualization Development**: Advanced plotting and animation tools

### Dependencies & Risk Mitigation
- **Low Risk Start**: Boundary mapping proof-of-concept builds directly on existing sample code
- **Incremental Validation**: Each phase provides standalone value
- **Fallback Options**: Even failed advanced features still yield basic spectral regularization insights
- **Modular Design**: Components can be developed and tested independently

## Success Definition
**Minimum Success**: Demonstrate that spectral regularization improves boundary learning efficiency with clear visual evidence.

**Target Success**: Full adaptive ASISR system that automatically optimizes neural networks for complex decision boundary learning.

**Stretch Success**: Theoretical framework generalizes to transformers and other architectures, with publication-quality results.

## Next Immediate Actions

2. **Claude Code Research** (parallel context) 
3. **Map Loader Implementation** (this context)
4. **Baseline Boundary Learning** (this context)
5. **Spectral Regularization Integration** (this context)
