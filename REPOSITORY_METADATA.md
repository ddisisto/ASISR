```

### **Repository Name**
- Current: `ASISR`
- **Recommended**: `SPECTRA` (or keep current to preserve URLs/forks)

### **Social Preview**
- Will auto-generate from README.md content
- Should show: "SPECTRA: Spectral Performance Control..." 

## Manual Steps Required

1. Go to https://github.com/ddisisto/ASISR/settings
2. Update "About" section with description above
3. Add topics listed above
4. Consider renaming repository if URL preservation isn't critical
5. Verify social preview reflects new content

## ChatGPT-5 Review Item Status

âœ… **RESOLVED**: "Repo clarity: docs visible but code views spotty"
- README.md now provides clear project overview
- About section will show research focus
- Topics will improve discoverability
