# ‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHIVED: Outdated Phase 3 Visualization Handover

**IMPORTANT WARNING**: This handover document was based on **incorrect experimental claims** that have since been refuted. **DO NOT USE** for visualization or analysis planning.

**Archived Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Reason**: Based on false breakthrough claims with experimental control errors  
**Current Status**: Phase 3 showed minimal effects (~0.2%), not breakthroughs

## ‚ùå **Why This Handover is Outdated**

**Based on False Claims**:
- "Major breakthrough achieved" - **REFUTED**
- "8x8 architecture -1.1% ‚Üí +1.9% improvement" - **NO PROPER CONTROL**
- "100% accuracy with capacity-adaptive" - **NO BASELINE COMPARISON**
- "Cross-dataset generalization confirmed" - **METHODOLOGY ERRORS**

**Actual Results** (with proper controls):
- +0.21% vs linear baseline (p=0.67, not significant)
- No statistical significance in effect sizes
- Framework works but effects are minimal

## üîç **Current Visualization Needs** 

For **accurate** visualization planning, focus on:

1. **Honest Effect Sizes**: Show actual ~0.2% effects with confidence intervals
2. **Proper Controls**: Compare only within matched experimental conditions  
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Emphasize p-values and effect size limitations
4. **Framework Validation**: Show that implementation works, even if effects are small
