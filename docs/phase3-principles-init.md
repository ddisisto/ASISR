# SPECTRA Phase 3: Scale-Invariant Optimization Principles

**Context**: Strategic pivot to fundamental principles following Phase 2B breakthrough  
**Mission**: Discover universal optimization principles emerging from criticality physics  
**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Branch**: `fundamental-principles-pivot`

## **Phase 2B Foundation** ✅ **BREAKTHROUGH VALIDATED**

**Scientific Discovery**: Dynamic spectral control achieves +1.1% accuracy improvement (p=0.0344, large effect size)  
**Key Insight**: Training-phase-dependent σ scheduling optimizes performance-variance trade-offs  
**Infrastructure**: Complete plugin architecture, statistical frameworks, multi-seed validation ✅  

**This proves the fundamental hypothesis**: Neural networks CAN be optimally controlled through spectral properties.

## **Phase 3 Research Questions**

### **Central Hypothesis**: Scale-invariant optimization methods emerge naturally from criticality physics

**Specific Questions**:
1. **Power-Law Learning Rates**: How should learning rates scale with distance from criticality?
2. **Self-Organized Criticality**: Do networks naturally evolve toward σ ≈ 1.0 without forcing?
3. **Criticality-Aware Optimization**: Can we develop optimizers that respect spectral properties?

## **Experimental Design Strategy**

### **Experiment 1: Scale-Invariant Learning Rate Scheduling**
**Hypothesis**: `lr(t) = lr_base * |σ(t) - 1.0|^(-α)` outperforms standard schedules

**Implementation Plan**:
```python
# spectra/optimization/critical_schedulers.py
class CriticalityAwareLRScheduler:
    def __init__(self, base_lr=1e-3, alpha=0.5):
        self.base_lr = base_lr
        self.alpha = alpha
    
    def get_lr(self, model, current_lr):
        avg_sigma = compute_spectral_radius(model)
        distance_from_critical = abs(avg_sigma - 1.0)
        scale_factor = (distance_from_critical + 1e-6) ** (-self.alpha)
        return self.base_lr * scale_factor
```

**Test Matrix**:
- α ∈ [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0] (power-law exponents)
- Compare vs: Cosine, Step, Exponential, Constant schedules
- Datasets: TwoMoons, Circles, Belgium-Netherlands boundary
- Metrics: Convergence speed, final accuracy, training stability

### **Experiment 2: Self-Organized Criticality Discovery**
**Hypothesis**: Networks naturally evolve toward σ ≈ 1.0 during standard training

**Implementation Plan**:
```python
# spectra/experiments/self_organization.py
class SelfOrganizedCriticalityExperiment:
    def track_natural_evolution(self, model, data, epochs=200):
        # Train with NO spectral regularization
        # Track σ evolution across all layers
        # Measure convergence toward σ ≈ 1.0
        # Compare "free" vs "guided" evolution
```

**Key Measurements**:
- Natural σ trajectories across layers and time
- Time to reach σ ≈ 1.0 without intervention
- Performance difference: self-organized vs regularized
- Stability analysis: does σ ≈ 1.0 persist?

### **Experiment 3: Criticality-Aware Optimizers**
**Hypothesis**: Gradient updates that respect spectral properties improve training

**Implementation Plan**:
```python
# spectra/optimization/critical_optimizers.py
class SpectralMomentum(torch.optim.Optimizer):
    """Momentum optimizer with criticality-aware updates"""
    
class CriticalAdam(torch.optim.Optimizer):
    """Adam optimizer with spectral property feedback"""
```

**Novel Mechanisms**:
- Momentum scaling based on distance from criticality
- Adaptive learning rates per layer based on local σ
- Gradient clipping informed by spectral analysis
