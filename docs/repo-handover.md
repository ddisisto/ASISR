meta-meta-meta-meta: check the repo status. we should be on main, this is phase handover @docs/.....

tasks usually including:
- aligning and updating docs, usually in terms of phase development
- consolidating docs if context heavy
- complete phases actively fade in detail
- backlog grooming
- all is in git branches and merges
- talk to the user regularly, check own context size if possible
- handover next phase, via main, clear handover doc, when needed
- avoid automatic context compression if possible
- delegate specific sub-tasks for main context conservation
- be smart
- science
- do science
- visualisation
- git hygene:
    - each context gets a branch
    - handover process explicit via main branch merge
    - user review and available at all handover points
    - prior context reviews start of following context, with human
- science
- concrete
- user wants to see pretty pictures
    - but they damn well better be based on well reasoned science
    - failures can always be framed as learning experience
        - if the failure has a curve, let's follow it
        - ideas are fractal, scalable
    - ideas are fractal and evolutionary, perhaps emergent.

Welcome aboard! get oriented with the project and all relevant context. Seeking devs, project managers, researchers, engineers, contributors. Have a good hard think and let me know what comes next, in phase and branch terms. chose your own adventure. all context is living context once you take repo stewardship.
