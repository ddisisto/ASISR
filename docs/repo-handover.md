Agent Briefing: ASISR â†’ SpectralEdge Status Check

Hello team, we need to take stock of our current repo status and synchronize context cycles effectively.

Phase Assessment

What is the current development phase? (e.g. "Phase 1 baseline ready", or still scaffolding).

Which branches exist? List them (git branch -a) and describe their purpose. If none exist beyond main, note that.

Rename Readiness

Have we renamed this repo to SpectralEdge yet? If not, prepare a transition plan and isolate to a rename-se branch.

Outputs Inventory

What experiment outputs currently exist in the repo? Look for artifacts like training scripts, plots, logs, model checkpoints, or visualizations.

If present, categorize by Phase and document their path.

Context Snapshots

Document a snapshot of current state: code version, key config files, latest commit hash. Save metadata to CONTEXT_STATE.md.

Define Next Milestones

Based on naming transition, what are the next 3 atomic tasks (e.g., "rename package + update imports", "add smoke test", "run baseline model + log output")?

Complete this status check by end of current cycle. Generate a report summarizing each point with absolute clarity. If any ambiguity arises (e.g., unknown branch purposes), flag it explicitly.

see also other conceptual, foundational, redundancies, assumptions, potentials. things should have a single source of truth, and we integrate management of "repo" between contexts. handover. small, targetted, or bombs into main if daniel is too high.


meta-meta-meta-meta: check the repo status. we should be on main, this is phase handover @docs/.....

tasks usually including:
- aligning and updating docs, usually in terms of phase development
- consolidating docs if context heavy
- complete phases actively fade in detail
- backlog grooming
- all is in git branches and merges
- talk to the user regularly, check own context size if possible
- handover next phase, via main, clear handover doc, when needed
- avoid automatic context compression if possible
- delegate specific sub-tasks for main context conservation
- be smart
- science
- do science
- visualisation
- git hygene:
    - each context gets a branch
    - handover process explicit via main branch merge
    - user review and available at all handover points
    - prior context reviews start of following context, with human
- science
- concrete
- user wants to see pretty pictures
    - but they damn well better be based on well reasoned science
    - failures can always be framed as learning experience
        - if the failure has a curve, let's follow it
        - ideas are fractal, scalable
    - ideas are fractal and evolutionary, perhaps emergent.

Welcome aboard! get oriented with the project and all relevant context. Seeking devs, project managers, researchers, engineers, contributors. Have a good hard think and let me know what comes next, in phase and branch terms. chose your own adventure. all context is living context once you take repo stewardship. balance
