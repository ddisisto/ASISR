Here are the biggest “watch-outs” I see for ASISR right now, plus quick mitigations so your agent collaborators can act immediately.

# Key concerns & pitfalls (with fast fixes)

1. **Name collision with CV/ASISR literature**
   “ASISR” is a well-known acronym for *arbitrary-scale image super-resolution* (active papers and repos in 2023–2025). This will confuse search, citations, and contributors. ([CVF Open Access][1], [arXiv][2])
   **Fix:** Rename the project or expand the acronym prominently (e.g., *Adaptive Spectral Invariant Stability Regularization*), and add a one-line disclaimer at the top of the README to avoid conflation with super-resolution.

2. **Thin commit surface / unclear momentum signals**
   The repo shows \~**12 commits**, **2 contributors** (you + “Claude”), and no issues/PRs yet. That’s fine for a seed, but it weakens perceived trajectory and makes context reconstruction harder for agents. ([GitHub][3])
   **Fix:**

* Open issues for each near-term task (Phase-1 experiments, metrics, baselines).
* Land small, atomic PRs (even if you self-review) so the history narrates intent.
* Add a CHANGELOG.md so agents can parse deltas without diffing everything.

3. **Repo clarity: docs visible but code views spotty**
   Top-level docs (ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md, PROJECT\_PLAN.md) are present, but GitHub UI intermittently fails to render file contents (likely temporary). Even when stable, the repo “About” section is empty and there’s no quickstart. ([GitHub][3])
   **Fix:**

* Add short README with: 2-minute quickstart, one command to run Phase-1 experiment, and a diagram of the plugin interfaces.
* Fill the repo description/topics so discovery and intent are clear.

4. **“Edge-of-chaos” control can be brittle**
   Enforcing spectral radius ≈ 1 across layers is theoretically appealing but easy to destabilize in practice (estimation noise, optimizer interaction, batch dependence).
   **Fix:**

* Prefer **regularization/monitoring** over direct parameter rescaling: add a per-layer penalty `(σ_max−1)^2` computed on a small probe set; backprop jointly with task loss.
* Clip updates and tie them to validation signals (disable when val loss worsens).
* Cache σ\_max estimates across steps; update each layer every *k* steps to reduce noise.

5. **Jacobian/σmax estimation cost & variance**
   Power iteration per layer per step can be expensive and noisy; finite differences in input space can mislead if scales differ.
   **Fix:**

* Use **mixed-frequency probes** (random unit vectors + a few persistent directions).
* Update σ\_max on a **staggered schedule** (e.g., 1 layer per step round-robin).
* Track confidence (moving std) for each layer’s estimate; gate control on high-confidence updates only.

6. **Metrics still easy to game / misread**
   Activation-based “dead neuron %”, perturbation sensitivity, and fractal boundary measures can disagree or drift with batch composition and grid resolution.
   **Fix:**

* Predefine **frozen probe sets** (fixed 2D grids and seed points) for all runs.
* Report **mean±CI over seeds** and **sensitivity to grid resolution** (e.g., 200×200 vs 400×400).
* Add at least two orthogonal complexity proxies (e.g., local Lipschitz histogram + boundary length) and require both to move in the right direction.

7. **Risk of overfitting to a single cartographic task**
   The Baarle border task is visually compelling but idiosyncratic (topology, enclaves). Conclusions may not transfer.
   **Fix:**

* Keep Baarle as the “hero” visualization, but add 2–3 **synthetic 2D suites** (moons, circles, checkerboard) as parallel tracks for every experiment.
* Declare generalization criteria up front (e.g., improvement must hold on ≥2 datasets).

8. **Baselines not yet enumerated**
   Without strong baselines (LeakyReLU/ELU, BatchNorm/LayerNorm, spectral norm, gradient clipping), it’s hard to attribute gains to the criticality control.
   **Fix:**

* Lock an explicit baseline grid now (activations × norm layers × init × clipping).
* Make a tiny YAML experiment matrix so agents can fan out runs consistently.

9. **Agent-centric workflow gaps**
   You’ve written to agents (“Claude” listed as contributor), but the repo lacks automation hooks that make agents effective: task templates, deterministic environments, context windows. ([GitHub][3])
   **Fix:**

* Add `/tasks/` with short, single-goal task specs (input→output contracts, acceptance checks) so agents can pick up work with minimal context.
* Provide a **Makefile** with phony targets (`env`, `train_p1`, `eval_p1`, `plots_p1`).
* Pin an **env.lock** (exact package versions) and add **repro seeds** in config.
* Store **artifact manifests** (where metrics/plots live) so agents can reference outputs by path rather than searching.

10. **Reproducibility & governance**
    No CI, no tests visible from the landing page, and no data provenance note for the map data (license/attribution). ([GitHub][3])
    **Fix:**

* Add a minimal **CI**: lint + unit test for the spectral monitor and one end-to-end smoke test (tiny grid).
* Include a **DATA.md** with source, license, and preprocessing steps.
* Add CODEOWNERS to route future PR reviews—even if it’s just you/agent today.

11. **Ambiguity in success criteria**
    “Criticality” still risks being a moving target; without predeclared decision rules, you can rationalize any outcome.
    **Fix:**

* Pre-register Phase-1 decision rules in PROJECT\_PLAN.md: e.g., “Accept ASISR control if: (a) equal or better accuracy vs baseline on ≥2 datasets, and (b) statistically significant improvement in boundary length\@fixed error or in Lipschitz tail index, with Holm–Bonferroni-corrected p<0.05.”

## Quick “agent-ready” checklist to land this week

* README: 2-minute quickstart, renamed/clarified acronym, data license note. ([GitHub][3])
* config/: YAMLs for baseline vs spectral-regularized runs (with seeds).
* scripts/: `train_p1.py`, `eval_p1.py`, `plot_p1.py`; Makefile targets wrap them.
* tests/: unit test for σ\_max estimator (deterministic toy layer) and a smoke E2E on a 64×64 grid.
* .github/workflows/: lint + tests on Python 3.11, upload artifacts (plots, CSV).
* issues/: create 6–10 granular issues so agents can self-assign and work in parallel.
* CHANGELOG.md + short “Roadmap” in PROJECT\_PLAN.md that maps directly to issues/PRs.

If you want, I can draft the README quickstart + Makefile + minimal CI yaml and a tiny σ\_max unit test that matches your interfaces so your agents can drop them in and go.
