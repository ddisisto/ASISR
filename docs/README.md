## üîç **Quick Research Status**

**Current Reality**: Spectral regularization framework is functional with measurable but small effects (~0.2-1%). Initial claims of larger breakthroughs were based on experimental control errors.

**What Works**: Implementation, metrics, statistical methodology  
**What Doesn't**: Universal benefits, large effect sizes, predictive capacity theory

**For Complete Assessment**: See `research-status-summary.md`
