# Phase 4A: Practical Conditions Discovery

**Duration**: 4 weeks  
**Goal**: Test IF spectral regularization helps at reasonable scale using existing infrastructure  
**Approach**: Strategic sampling of the experimental space, not exhaustive coverage

---

## 🎯 **Simplified Research Question**

**Core Question**: "Does spectral regularization provide >1% improvement when we scale up from toy problems to realistic ones?"

**Strategy**: Use existing SPECTRA infrastructure, add GPU acceleration, test strategic points rather than exhaustive grid

---

## 🧪 **Strategic Experimental Design**

### **Architecture Scale-Up** (Build on existing)
```python
# Start with working 8x8 from Phase 3, scale strategically
architectures = [
    [8, 8],      # Phase 3 baseline - known territory
    [32, 32],    # 4x scale-up - modest step  
    [64, 64],    # 8x scale-up - significant but manageable
    [128, 64],   # Different depth/width ratio
]
# Total: 4 architectures (not 7)
```

### **Dataset Focus** (Leverage existing + add one realistic)
```python
datasets = [
    "TwoMoons",     # Known baseline from Phase 3
    "Circles",      # Known baseline from Phase 3
    "MNIST",        # Standard benchmark - realistic scale
]
# Total: 3 datasets (not 8)
```

### **Training Regime** (Strategic time points)
```python
training_configs = [
    {"epochs": 100},   # Phase 3 baseline
    {"epochs": 500},   # 5x longer - test cumulative effects
]
# Total: 2 training lengths (not 7)
```

### **Regularization Focus** (Test best candidates)
```python
regularization_configs = [
    {"type": "none"},                                    # Baseline
    {"type": "linear", "initial": 2.5, "final": 1.0},   # Phase 2 validated
    {"type": "adaptive", "beta": -0.2},                  # Phase 3 implementation
]
# Total: 3 methods (not 11)
```

## 📊 **Manageable Experimental Scale**

### **Total Experiment Count**
```
Architectures:    4
Datasets:         3  
Training configs: 2
Regularizations:  3
Seeds per exp:   10
─────────────────────
Total experiments: 4 × 3 × 2 × 3 × 10 = 720 individual runs
```

### **Computational Reality Check**
```python
# Conservative estimates with GPU acceleration
runtime_estimates = {
    "8x8, 100 epochs":   "2 minutes",
    "8x8, 500 epochs":   "8 minutes", 
    "64x64, 100 epochs": "5 minutes",
    "64x64, 500 epochs": "20 minutes",
}

# Total compute: ~60 GPU hours = 2.5 days continuous
# Realistic timeline: 1 week with normal scheduling
```

## 🗓️ **Practical 4-Week Timeline**

### **Week 1: Infrastructure Adaptation**
- Adapt existing experiment runner for GPU
- Add larger architecture support to SPECTRA framework
- Test MNIST integration with existing data loaders
- Validate that 64x64+ architectures work correctly

### **Week 2: Baseline Establishment**  
- Run all baseline experiments (no regularization)
- Establish performance benchmarks at each scale
- Identify any technical issues with larger networks
- Validate that results make intuitive sense

### **Week 3: Spectral Regularization Testing**
- Run linear and adaptive regularization experiments  
- Focus on systematic comparisons vs matched baselines
- Monitor for GPU memory/performance issues
- Look for patterns in where benefits might emerge

### **Week 4: Analysis & Decision**
- Statistical analysis with proper corrections
- Effect size calculation and significance testing
- Decision: Does scaling up further look promising?
- Document findings and next-step recommendations

## 🎯 **Strategic Sampling Logic**

### **Why These Architectures?**
- **8x8**: Known baseline from Phase 3 work
- **32x32**: Modest scale-up, ~10x parameters 
- **64x64**: Significant scale-up, ~50x parameters
- **128x64**: Different shape, test depth vs width

### **Why These Datasets?**
- **TwoMoons/Circles**: Known baselines, controlled complexity
- **MNIST**: Realistic scale, standard benchmark, known performance expectations

### **Why These Training Lengths?**
- **100 epochs**: Phase 3 baseline, direct comparison possible
- **500 epochs**: Test if benefits emerge with more training time

### **Why These Regularization Methods?**  
- **None**: Essential baseline
- **Linear**: Phase 2 validated approach
- **Adaptive**: Phase 3 implementation - test if it helps at scale

---

## 🔍 **Key Questions This Design Addresses**

1. **Scale Sensitivity**: Do benefits emerge as networks get larger?
2. **Training Time**: Do benefits accumulate over longer training?
3. **Task Complexity**: Do benefits depend on problem complexity (synthetic vs real)?
4. **Method Comparison**: Which regularization approach works best (if any)?

## 📋 **Success Criteria (Realistic)**

### **Green Light for Scaling Up**
- **Effect Size**: >1% improvement in at least one condition
- **Consistency**: Benefits appear across multiple architectures or datasets
- **Statistical Significance**: p<0.05 after correction for ~24 comparisons
- **Practical Relevance**: Benefits justify computational overhead

### **Yellow Light (Mixed Results)**
- **Small Effects**: 0.5-1% improvements in some conditions
- **Inconsistent**: Benefits only in very specific cases
- **Action**: Document limitations, consider narrow continuation

### **Red Light (Stop Here)**
- **No Benefits**: <0.5% effects or no statistical significance
- **Computational Cost**: Overhead never justified
- **Action**: Archive direction, focus elsewhere

## 🛠️ **Implementation Using Existing Infrastructure**

### **Leverage What We Have**
- **Existing configs**: Adapt Phase 3 configs for new architectures
- **Existing models**: Extend SpectralMLP for larger sizes
- **Existing regularizers**: Already implemented and tested
- **Existing metrics**: Reuse statistical analysis framework

### **Minimal New Infrastructure**
- **GPU configs**: Update existing configs with `device: "auto"`
- **MNIST integration**: Add to existing data loading system
- **Larger architecture support**: Extend existing model configs
- **Result analysis**: Build on existing statistical tools

## 💡 **This Approach Gives Us**

1. **Quick Start**: Build on established patterns, not from scratch
2. **Clear Decision Point**: Definitive answer on whether scaling looks promising  
3. **Manageable Scope**: 720 experiments vs 43k - actually doable in 4 weeks
4. **Strategic Sampling**: Tests key hypotheses without exhaustive search
5. **Natural Next Steps**: If positive, provides clear direction for bigger scale

---

## 🤔 **Does This Feel Right?**

**720 experiments** that can run in **1 week of GPU time** and give us a **clear answer** on whether spectral regularization benefits emerge at realistic scales.

If we find benefits, we can scale up further. If we don't, we can stop with confidence that we tested the right things at the right scale.
