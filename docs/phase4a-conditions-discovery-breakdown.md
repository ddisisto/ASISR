## 🎯 **Core Research Questions**

### **Primary**: Does spectral regularization ever help meaningfully?
- **Threshold**: >1% improvement with p<0.01  
- **Scope**: Across architectures, datasets, training regimes  
- **Null Hypothesis**: No meaningful benefits exist under systematic testing

### **Secondary**: What are the computational trade-offs?
- **Overhead**: Training time increase vs performance gains
- **Memory**: Additional GPU memory requirements  
- **Scalability**: How costs scale with network/dataset size
