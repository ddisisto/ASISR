# SPECTRA Phase 2A Implementation: Multi-σ Spectral Trade-off Characterization

**Current Status**: Phase 1 COMPLETED with statistical validation - Performance-variance trade-off characterized with large effect size between baseline (80.3%±2.9%) and spectral (77.9%±0.0%) methods.

**Your Mission**: Implement Phase 2A systematic characterization of σ-performance-variance relationships across datasets and applications.

**Active Phase**: Phase 2A - Spectral Trade-off Characterization  
**Central Question**: *"How do performance-variance trade-offs in spectral regularization inform optimal neural network control strategies?"*  
**Next Milestone**: Multi-σ characterization across datasets and applications

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Multi-σ Experiment Framework**: Extend existing Belgium-Netherlands experiments to sweep σ ∈ [1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
2. **Synthetic Dataset Pipeline**: Implement two-moons, circles, checkerboard complexity ladder validation
3. **Application Domain Analysis**: Framework for different success criteria (safety vs performance)
4. **Statistical Framework**: Trade-off optimization with proper effect size reporting

## Success Criteria

- **Minimum**: Reproducible σ-performance-variance curves across 3+ datasets
- **Target**: Application-specific σ selection framework with validation  
- **Stretch**: Predictive model for optimal σ given task characteristics

## Key Resources

- **Technical Authority**: `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Plugin interfaces already implemented
- **Research Strategy**: `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Phase 2A scope lines 77-105
- **Development Standards**: `docs/engineering-patterns.md` - Proven patterns from Phase 1
- **Working Package**: `spectra/` - Complete plugin architecture ready for extension
- **Phase 1 Validation**: All tests passing, Belgium-Netherlands baseline established

## Repository State

- ✅ Clean git status, properly organized structure
- ✅ 7 tests passing with good fractal dimension coverage  
- ✅ Core dependencies accessible, SPECTRA package imports correctly
- ✅ Phase 1 Belgium-Netherlands results: Statistical validation complete
- ✅ Plugin architecture interfaces implemented and tested

## Development Approach

**Phase Discipline**: Complete Phase 2A validation before proceeding to Phase 2B dynamic strategies.

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Extend existing `experiments/phase1_boundary_mapping/` to multi-σ framework
2. Add synthetic datasets to `spectra/data/` following real-data-throughout pattern
3. Create configuration-driven σ sweep experiments with statistical rigor
4. Generate publication-quality trade-off characterization figures

**Engineering Standards**:
- Plugin architecture with abstract interfaces (already implemented)
- Statistical rigor: 5+ seeds, effect sizes, confidence intervals
- Micro-commit workflow with clean git hygiene
- Real data throughout (no synthetic fallbacks on critical path)
- <10% training overhead vs baseline

**Critical Requirements**:
- Follow existing `SpectralRegularizedModel` and `SpectralRegularizer` interfaces
- Maintain statistical rigor framework from Phase 1
- Configuration-driven experiments (YAML) for reproducibility
- Incremental validation with comprehensive testing

Begin implementation immediately - the foundation is solid and Phase 2A scope is well-defined.
