# SPECTRA: Spectral Performance Control Through Regularization Analysis

> **Research Focus**: Understanding performance-variance trade-offs in neural networks through spectral radius control

*Note: This project was previously called "ASISR" but was renamed to avoid collision with image super-resolution literature.*

## What We Discovered

**Phase 1 Results** (Belgium-Netherlands boundary classification, 5 seeds, 100 epochs):

- **âœ… Spectral Control Works**: Successfully moved spectral radius from ~3.2 â†’ ~2.0
- **ðŸ“Š Performance-Variance Trade-off Identified**: -2.5% accuracy for ~100% variance reduction
- **ðŸ“ˆ Large Effect Size**: Cohen's d = -1.196 (highly reproducible phenomenon)
- **ðŸŽ¯ Precise Measurements**: Baseline 80.3% Â± 2.9% vs Spectral 77.9% Â± 0.0%

**Key Insight**: Rather than improving performance, spectral regularization reveals a measurable trade-off between peak accuracy and training consistency.

## Quick Start

Run Phase 1 boundary learning experiment to reproduce findings:

```bash
# Setup environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run unified experiment (comparison mode)
cd experiments/phase1_boundary_mapping
python unified_experiment.py --mode comparison --seeds 5 --epochs 100

# Results saved to: results/comparison_[timestamp]/
```

**Expected Output**: Statistical comparison showing spectral regularization's variance reduction with performance cost.

## Research Directions

**Current Investigation**: Characterizing the Ïƒ-performance-variance relationship across:
- **Spectral Operating Points**: Optimal Ïƒ selection for different applications
- **Application Domains**: Safety-critical systems, ensemble methods, production deployment  
- **Dynamic Control**: Training-phase-dependent spectral strategies
- **Multi-Dataset Validation**: Boundary complexity vs spectral requirements

**Next Phase**: Application-driven spectral control based on empirical trade-off characterization.
