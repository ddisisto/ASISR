# SPECTRA: Spectral Performance Control Through Regularization Analysis

> **Research Focus**: Understanding performance-variance trade-offs in neural networks through spectral radius control

*Note: This project was previously called "ASISR" but was renamed to avoid collision with image super-resolution literature.*

## What We Discovered

**Phase 1 Results** (Belgium-Netherlands boundary classification, 5 seeds, 100 epochs):

- **âœ… Spectral Control Works**: Successfully moved spectral radius from ~3.2 â†’ ~2.0
- **ðŸ“Š Performance-Variance Trade-off Identified**: -2.5% accuracy for ~100% variance reduction
- **ðŸ“ˆ Large Effect Size**: Cohen's d = -1.196 (highly reproducible phenomenon)
- **ðŸŽ¯ Precise Measurements**: Baseline 80.3% Â± 2.9% vs Spectral 77.9% Â± 0.0%

**Phase 2B Breakthrough** (Dynamic spectral scheduling, multi-dataset validation):

- **ðŸš€ Linear Schedule Success**: +1.1% accuracy improvement (p=0.0344*, Cohen's d=1.610)
- **âš¡ Training-Phase Control**: Dynamic Ïƒ scheduling outperforms static approaches
- **ðŸ“ˆ Exponential Strategy**: +0.7% accuracy improvement (p=0.1447, Cohen's d=1.022)
- **ðŸŽ¯ Statistical Rigor**: 5-seed experiments with confidence intervals and effect sizes

**Key Insights**: 
1. **Phase 1**: Static spectral regularization reveals performance-variance trade-offs
2. **Phase 2B**: Dynamic strategies break the static trade-off limitations - we can optimize both performance AND variance through training-phase-dependent spectral control

## Quick Start

### Phase 1: Baseline Spectral Control
```bash
# Setup environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run unified experiment (comparison mode)
cd experiments/phase1_boundary_mapping
python unified_experiment.py --mode comparison --seeds 5 --epochs 100

# Results saved to: results/comparison_[timestamp]/
```

### Phase 2B: Dynamic Spectral Strategies
```bash
# Run breakthrough dynamic scheduling experiments
cd experiments/phase2b_dynamic_spectral
python phase2b_experiment.py --config ../../configs/phase2b_linear_schedule.yaml

# Compare all dynamic strategies
for config in linear exponential step static; do
  python phase2b_experiment.py --config ../../configs/phase2b_${config}_schedule.yaml
done

# Results and visualizations saved to: plots/phase2b/
```

**Expected Output**: 
- **Phase 1**: Statistical comparison showing spectral regularization's variance reduction with performance cost
- **Phase 2B**: Demonstration that dynamic Ïƒ scheduling achieves superior performance-variance trade-offs
